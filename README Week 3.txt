Allen BoyntonImmersive Application Deployment 1609LeaderboardsGithub: https://github.com/AllenBoynton/IAD-1609/tree/master/Sky%20EscapeLeaderboard is applied using Game Center. Game Center pops up upon opening app and asks for user and password. If logged in already, it will say hello and continue. I am still unable to get any of my objects to make contact; therefore, I can score no points to end the game. The game ends after all lives are gone and then the Game Over screen would pop up and reveal the final score on Game Center’s leaderboard. At that point you would be able to socially share your high-score and others playing the game. Without getting to the point of scoring a single point, I cannot tell where it may go from there. The code is good to complete it.Is it possible to take a look at my physics for contact? I have my delegate, contact bit masks set correctly and my didBeginContact function is correct. I have tried many options of this function and it seems not to get any communication. It will not print out anything I set within a contact statement. This has cost me in the past and I will not be able to get past this if I cannot get contact. That is as much as I can tell you about the leaderboard. Everything else works wonderful except a splash screen image not showing. I even got the pause working correctly with the timers and spawning and the credit info button work to finally show my credits.
